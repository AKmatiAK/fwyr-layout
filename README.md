Keyboard layout optimized for polish

It's based on [engram](https://github.com/binarybottle/engram/) layout, but at the moment differs a lot. Polish characters arranged almost all on home row.

For Linux and Windows. On Linux just change /usr/share/X11/xkb/pl. To install on Windows you need to download MSKLC first, load .klc file -> project -> build DLL and setup package. Then simply install .exe from build directory.

# Update - v5
- stable, I use it since almost a year
- probably final

# Update - v4
- just further upgrades

# Update - v3
now this layout is OP for polish, and good for english too ;)
- move two wovels for right hand
- W and J moved to home row
- extended home and bottom row
- D moved to more comfortable position
- F moved back to original position


# Update - v2 for some corrections
- consonants and vowels separation to reduce one finger sequences
- POU block relocation
- KLR moved to right side top row for better hand alternation and ergonomics
- V moved to left, i think it's better place for it

I also highly recommend to try ctrl-capslock swap and sticky buttons - it significaly improves ergonomics
