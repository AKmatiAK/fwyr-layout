Keyboard layout optimized for polish

It's based on [engram](https://github.com/binarybottle/engram/) layout, with some modifications and without punctuation marks in the middle. Polish characters arranged all on home row. Simple key swap possible on most keyboards - punctuation mark pairs are preserved. No changes in numbers row. There is no slash near left shift as on image - msklc displays layout weird.

Currently I have setup for Windows only, pull requests for Linux are welcome. To install you need to download MSKLC first, load .klc file -> project -> build DLL and setup package. Then simply install .exe from build directory.

* Update - v2 for some corrections
- consonants and vowels separation to reduce one finger sequences
- POU block relocation
- KLR moved to right side top row for better hand alternation and ergonomics
- V moved to left, i think it's better place for it

I also highly recommend to try ctrl-capslock swap and sticky buttons - it significaly improves ergonomics
