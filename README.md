Keyboard layout optimized for polish

It's based on [engram](https://github.com/binarybottle/engram/) layout, with some modifications and without punctuation marks in the middle. Polish characters arranged all on home row. Simple key swap possible on most keyboards - punctuation mark pairs are preserved. No changes in numbers row.

Currently I have setup for Windows only, pull requests for Linux are welcome.
